# Introduction
I've recently found an old Rubik's cube so naturally I decided to record my times, for every single one of my completed solves. At the time of inception the my fastest time was ~12 minutes using extensive instructions and my current fastest time is 1:16.60. These times are far from speed cuber times which can be sub 10 seconds.

# Spreadsheet
I use www.cubetimer.com to time my solves and record them on a spreadsheet I keep on my desktop. There are currently 71 solves, and I'l update this repo whenever I break a new personal record or at about every 20 solves.

# PlotCube.py
This is a simple Python script that renders a matplotlib plot from the Excel sheet data. The spreadsheet data is stored as text instead of date-time objects so some basic string manipulation has to be done. Here's the result:
