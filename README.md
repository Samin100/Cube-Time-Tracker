# Introduction
I've recently found an old Rubik's cube so naturally I decided to record my times, for every single one of my completed solves. At the time of inception the my fastest time was ~12 minutes using extensive instructions and my current fastest time is 1 min and 16.60 seconds. 

# Spreadsheet
I use www.cubetimer.com to time my solves and record them on a spreadsheet I keep on my desktop. There are currently 79 solves, and I'll update this repo whenever I break a new personal record or at about every 20 solves.

# PlotCube.py
Python script that renders a plot from the data in CubeTimes.xlsx. The spreadsheet data is stored as text instead of date-time objects so some basic string manipulation has to be done. Here are the result:
